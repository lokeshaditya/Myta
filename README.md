# Remind Me
This application allows users to set reminders for their
important occasions/events. The project intends to send the reminders to the user
directly in to their mailbox event at 7am and 7pm one day prior to the , so that he never misses out!!!
The beauty of the project is that you can set reminders not only to yourself but also to your friends for every individual event.
i.e you can set the specific reminder to specified people only but not to others by specifying their email addresses.
for example, if you have your brother/sister's  birthday, you can send this reminder to your family members and cousines. Likewise, if you have colleague/classmate's b.day, you can send only to your other colleagues/classmates by specifying their mail Ids.
